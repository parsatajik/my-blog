			Welcome to my blog. I created this website to share my journey of building products in public
			and helping founders with their startups. I’m a software engineer based in Toronto (soon to be
			New York) who found himself to be very interested in manufacturing growth and understanding
			sales & marketing. I’m now actively building a variety of applications and running my boutique
			software development agency, <a
