I know it has been a while since I last wrote a post here but I promise that I'm going to be more active in 2024 ðŸ¤ž

This is quick one to share what I'm currently learning...

## The T3 Stack

A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon [this tweet](https://x.com/DhravyaShah/status/1739084863058198981?s=20) and was very impressed with [Dhravya Shah's](https://dhravya.dev/) work.

After exploring his personal website a bit, I found out that he mainly uses a stack called T3 which is popularized by the infamous [Theo](https://x.com/t3dotgg?s=20).

Upon furthrer research, I found [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) and went over Theo's stack [philosophy](https://create.t3.gg/en/why) & [FAQs](https://create.t3.gg/en/faq).

Honestly, I have to say that I'm very impressed and after years of delaying this decision, I'm finally going to switch (or at least try) T3 which includes:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)

I'm going to write a detailed post about my experience with T3 in the future but for now, I'm going to share [Theo's video](https://youtu.be/YkOSUVzOAA4) for those who are interested in learning more.

Stay tuned, I'm building a cool app... ðŸ¤«
