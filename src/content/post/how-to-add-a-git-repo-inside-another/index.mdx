just cloning the repo inside the parent is not going to be enough. we need to use git submodules.

follow these instructions:

- cd into the parent repo
- run git submodule add https://github.com/yourusername/the_repo_name
- commit and push your changes

if you've already cloned the repo by mistake and have committed it to the parent, use the following instead:

- run git rm -r --cached the_repo_name
- git commit -m "removed the child repo"
- run git submodule add https://github.com/yourusername/the_repo_name
- commit and push your changes
