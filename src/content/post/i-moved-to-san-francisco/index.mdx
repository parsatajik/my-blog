On Jan 8th, 2024, I moved to San Francisco. It's been a wild ride.

I've started a new position as a software engineer at Affirm! I'll be working on the Online Services team, building out the infrastructure that powers Affirm's online checkout experience.

The move from Canada to USA has been challenging. For contenxt, here are few things that I had to do in my first week (+ before getting here):

- Get an apartment with my friend Navid Pour
-- More on this later
- Get a Social Security Number
-- Steps to get SSN: https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/
- Get a bank account
-- I went with Chase, but there are many options
-- They did not ask for SSN, but I had to get a letter from Affirm which confirmed my employment + current address (my lease wasn't enough)
- Get a phone number
-- Got a company phone and changed my Canadian plan to a Canada + US plan
- Go to work!
-- Yes, I started work on my first day in the US.

Anyways, I wanted to briefly share the news. Super excited to see where this new adventure takes me.
